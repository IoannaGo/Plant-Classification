# Plant_Classification
Plant Classification using Artificial Neural Networks.
Code written in Python 3 , using Tensorflow 2.0 alongside with other libraries for the implementation.

# Dataset 
Dataset required: PlantCLEF 2017 competition dataset.'\n'
We use "trusted" training dataset & test dataset for this project.
We create new folders for both Training and Test dataset. Each folder contains 100 classes. Those classes must be the same name for Train & Test set (e.g. Training and Test folder must contain the class 23).
